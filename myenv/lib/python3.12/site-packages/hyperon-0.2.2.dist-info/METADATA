# Overview

OpenCog Hyperon is a substantially revised, novel version of OpenCog - which is currently at an active
pre-alpha stage of development and experimentation. One of the focuses in the Hyperon design is a successor
to the OpenCog Classic Atomese language with clear semantics supporting meta-language features,
different types of inference, etc. What we have landed on is an "Atomese 2" language called MeTTa (Meta Type Talk).

One can run MeTTa script from command line:

```
metta <name>.metta
```
